Setting up Motu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are two ways of using Motu:

  1) 100% Client Side

     In this configuration (the default), you load motu.html into
     your browser and are ready to go. Your notes are saved into a
     cookie file, giving you roughly 3800 bytes to play with.

  2) Client/Server

     This is a slightly more involved system to setup, but should be
     pretty easy on a Linux, BSD, or OS X system.

     A) Replace persist.js with the copy in the 'ajax' directory
     B) Copy the other files from 'ajax' into the top-level Motu
        directory
     C) Run 'perl tuari.pl'
     D) Point your browser to http://localhost:9812

     The advantage to this is that you get to store your files via
     a CGI script ('save.cgi'). Advanced users can set this up on a
     real web server and have access to their notes/code from any
     computer.

     This approach has no preset limits on the length of the notes
     file.

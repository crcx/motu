Motu
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a personal programming environment I've begun to use when
testing things in Retro.

Some Features:

  1) You can save your code + data into a cookie
  2) You can intermix code and data, and evaluate specific pieces
     of code
  3) It's 100% client side and can be used offline

Motu was written by Charles Childers and is gifted to the public
domain.
